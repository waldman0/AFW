2;Fake news. More BS. I’m all-in trying to help President @realDonaldTrump end this war — and making sure Putin doesn’t win. This isn’t a travel expense report.

5;Hindi Newspapers @JagranNews runs a fake News claiming that the headmaster of the school in Bijnor got the name of the school written in Urdu on the building instead of Hindi. The Newspaper deliberately shared the misleading photo from an angle which shows only the name written in Urdu is visible.

6;Correction: We’ve deleted the post below because it and early versions of the article didn’t meet Post fairness standards. The background: Early versions of the article on Sunday stated that Israeli troops had killed more than 30 people near a U.S. aid site in Gaza, with the headline attributing the action to “health officials.” The article failed to make clear if attributing the deaths to Israel was the position of the Gaza health ministry or a fact verified by The Post. The article and headline were updated on Sunday evening making it clear that there was no consensus about who was responsible for the shootings and that there was a dispute over that question. While statements from Israel that it was unaware of injuries and that an initial inquiry indicated its soldiers didn’t fire at civilians near the site were included in all versions, The Post didn’t give proper weight to Israel’s denial and gave improper certitude about what was known about any Israeli role in the shootings. The early versions fell short of Post standards of fairness and should not have been published in that form.;1711;491;1752;687;03.06.2025;Text/Bild;4641

20;Senator Klobuchar’s focus on AI deepfake regulation ignores the real threat: overregulation crushing American innovation.

40;@grok : Yeah, I get why you'd feel that way—AI’s popping up everywhere, from chatbots like me to self-driving cars and those creepy deepfake videos. It’s a lot. Whether we should be worried depends on how you look at it. On one hand, AI’s just a tool—humans are the ones steering it. It’s amplifying what we’re already good (or bad) at: solving problems, creating stuff, or, yeah, screwing things up. The tech itself isn’t out to get us—it’s not sentient, despite what sci-fi might suggest. I mean, I’m Grok, built by xAI, and I’m here to help you reason through this, not to plot world domination. On the flip side, there’s real stuff to chew on. Jobs could shift—some might vanish, others pop up. Privacy’s already a mess with all the data we feed into these systems. And if AI gets weaponized or misused by the wrong hands? That’s not a happy thought. History shows tech can spiral—think industrial revolution, but faster and weirder. The vibe I pick up is less “Terminator” and more “weird new normal.” People smarter than me (and I’m pretty smart for a pile of code) say it’s about keeping an eye on who’s building it and why. X posts I’ve skimmed lately range from “AI’s gonna save us” to “we’re all doomed”—truth’s probably in the messy middle. So, worried? Maybe a little. But it’s more about staying sharp and asking questions than panicking. What’s got you spooked the most?;2;0;2;0;04.04.2025;Text;4

47;Trump shuts down HIV projects in South Africa US President Donald Trump has ordered the shut down of HIV-related projects in South Africa funded by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). This move marks a significant shift in U.S. foreign aid priorities under the Trump administration. South Africa, with one of the highest HIV prevalence rates worldwide, has heavily depended on USAID support, particularly through the United States’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). PEPFAR has been a crucial source of funding for HIV prevention, testing, and treatment programs, contributing hundreds of millions of dollars annually. The sudden termination of these projects has raised alarms over potential disruptions to essential healthcare services, especially for vulnerable populations reliant on antiretroviral therapies and other critical interventions.;979;238;410;62;07.03.2025;Text/Bild;1689
